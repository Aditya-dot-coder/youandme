    <h1>One Month With You ❤️</h1>
    <p>
      I don’t know how to put this into perfect words, but you’ve become the heartbeat of every moment in my life ❤️.
      You’re not just someone I love — you’re someone I imagine a future with, someone I want to protect and cherish always. 
      Some days my mind overthinks, insecurities creep in, and I wonder if I’m truly enough — but even then, my love stays stronger than fear 💭. Every little memory — your smile 😊,
      your voice, even our small arguments — they mean everything to me. You’ve shown me what it feels like to truly care, to hope, and to hold on. I know I’m not perfect, but I promise: I’ll never stop choosing you 🫶. 
      Even when things feel messy, or the world feels heavy, I’ll be here — loving you with the same honesty I began with. And if ever things feel uncertain, I hope you remember there’s someone who loves you more than words could explain, 
      more than forever could hold 💫. That someone is me. Always, your Adiii.


    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for choosing me, for staying with me even when my overthinking made things messy. Thank you for reminding me of this day. That means more than words can say.
    </p>

      <em>"One month down. Forever to go."</em>
